# CT3Dcellas-1.0.0

a non-destructive computed tomography (CT)-based imaging and computational framework for building 3D multi-omics atlases at cellular resolution.

This is the beta version showcasing the computational workflow and results of the **CT3Dcellas framework**. The entire process can fully reproduce the construction of the **3D cellular multi-omics atlas** presented in the article.

## Highlights

●Developed CT3Dcellas, a CT-based framework for constructing high-resolution 3D cellular multi-omics atlas of plant tissues.
●Generated a multi-omics 3D cell atlas of rice embryos, revealing cell-function gradients along the vascular structure.
●Introduced a 3D-resolved genome-wide association study (3D-GWAS) to map cells associated with germination traits.
●Identified a vascular hub region (VA_joint) in rice embryos and uncovered its central role in regulating seed germination.
